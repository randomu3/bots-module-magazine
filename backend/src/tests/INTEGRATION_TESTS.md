## Test Setup and Configuration

### Environment Setup

The integration tests use a dedicated test environment with:

- Mocked external services (Telegram API, payment gateways, email services)
- In-memory database simulation for consistent test data
- Isolated test user accounts and data
- Controlled test scenarios and edge cases

### Mock Services

All external services are mocked to ensure:
- Consistent test results
- No external API calls during testing
- Controlled error scenarios
- Fast test execution
- No side effects on external systems

### Test Data Management

- Each test suite creates its own test users and data
- Test data is isolated between test runs
- Cleanup is performed automatically
- Predictable test scenarios with known data states

## Running Integration Tests

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js and npm installed
2. All dependencies installed (`npm install`)
3. Test environment variables configured

### Running All Integration Tests

```bash
# Run the complete integration test suite
npm run test:integration

# Run all tests (unit + integration)
npm run test:all

```

### Running Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Run a specific integration test file
npm run test:integration:single -- auth.integration.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern

npm run test:integration:single -- --watch
```

### Test Output and Reporting

The integration test runner generates:

1. **Console Output**: Real-time test progress and results
2. **JSON Report**: Detailed test results in `test-reports/integration-test-results.json`
3. **HTML Report**: Visual test report in `test-reports/integration-test-results.html`
4. **Coverage Report**: Code coverage analysis

   - Check for hanging promises or async operations
   - Verify mock service responses

2. **Mock Service Failures**
   - Ensure all external services are properly mocked
   - Check mock implementation consistency
   - Verify mock data matches expected formats

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify test database configuration
   - Check connection pool settings
   - Ensure proper cleanup between tests

4. **Memory Issues**
   - Monitor memory usage during test runs
   - Check for memory leaks in test code
   - Increase Node.js memory limits if needed

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Verbose Logging**
   ```bash
   npm run test:integration:single -- --verbose
   ```

2. **Run Individual Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:integration:single -- --testNamePattern="specific test name"
   ```

3. **Check Test Reports**
   - Review HTML report for detailed results
   - Analyze JSON report for programmatic access
   - Check coverage reports for gaps

## Contributing

### Adding New Integration Tests

1. **Create Test File**: Follow naming convention `*.integration.test.ts`
